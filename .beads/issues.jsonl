Reusable components ensure visual consistency and reduce code duplication.\n\nFUNCTIONS TO IMPLEMENT:\n\n1. render_metric_card(label, value, delta=None, help_text=None):\n   - Wrapper around st.metric with custom styling\n   - Support for positive/negative deltas\n   - Optional help tooltip\n   \n2. render_metric_grid(metrics_dict):\n   - Display multiple metrics in 3-column grid\n   - Input: dict of label: value, delta pairs\n   - Auto-layout in st.columns(3)\n   \n3. render_status_badge(status, message):\n   - Color-coded status indicators\n   - Green: success, Yellow: warning, Red: error\n   - Used for schema validation, data quality checks\n\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Use Streamlit native components (st.metric) for consistency\n- Support markdown in labels for rich formatting\n- Delta coloring: green for positive improvements\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLE:\nmetrics = {'Avg Mastery': (0.72, +0.05), 'Total Skills': (15, None)}\nrender_metric_grid(metrics)\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- All 3 functions work in Streamlit app\n- Grid layout renders correctly\n- Status badges show proper colors","notes":"Created components/metrics.py with reusable metric tiles + grid helper for dashboards.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-29T22:46:56.671543-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-29T23:01:06.497235-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-29T23:01:06.497238-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"deepKT+IRT-izl","depends_on_id":"deepKT+IRT-71e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-29T22:47:13.034402-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
